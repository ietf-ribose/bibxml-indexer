= BibXML indexer service & API

An indexing task can be added to queue by querying an API endpoint
of the form `<indexer domain>/api/v1/indexer/<dataset ID>/run`.

For example:

[source]
--
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/indexer/nist/run
--

With properly configured infrastructure across bibxml-service and bibxml-indexer,
given dataset will be indexed into a database accessible by bibxml-service APIs.

NOTE: Currently, indexer implementation is preliminary and relies on manual cloning of a repository. This will be addressed shortly.
